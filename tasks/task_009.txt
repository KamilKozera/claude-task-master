# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Export Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Create export options for finished chart configurations
# Details:
Implement functionality to export finished chart configuration as JSON, generate React/Next.js component code, download chart as image (PNG/SVG), and copy configuration to clipboard. Create clean, formatted output for generated code. Implement proper error handling for export operations. Add visual feedback during export processes. Optimize image export quality and file size.

# Test Strategy:
Validate exported JSON against ECharts schema. Test generated React components by importing them into a test project. Verify image exports produce correct visual output at appropriate quality. Test clipboard operations across different browsers. Check error handling by simulating export failures.
