# Product Requirements Document: NextCharts - Next.js UI Wrapper for Apache ECharts

## Overview
NextCharts is a comprehensive UI wrapper for Apache ECharts, built with Next.js. It provides an intuitive, component-based interface for configuring and customizing charts without requiring deep knowledge of the ECharts API. The product aims to streamline chart creation and configuration while maintaining the full power and flexibility of Apache ECharts.

## Problem Statement
Creating and configuring charts with Apache ECharts requires extensive knowledge of its API and configuration options. Developers need to write verbose JSON configurations, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Non-technical users are unable to create or modify charts without developer assistance.

## Target Users
1. Front-end developers using Next.js who need to create data visualizations
2. Dashboard creators with limited ECharts expertise
3. Technical product managers who need to prototype visualizations
4. Data analysts who want to create custom visualizations without coding

## Key Features

### 1. Chart Configuration UI
- Intuitive sidebar with categorized configuration options:
  - General settings
  - Layout
  - Text Style
  - Advanced
- Chart preview area with real-time updates
- Export options for finished charts

### 2. Chart Components Panel
- Collapsible panel with all available chart components:
  - Title
  - Legend
  - Grid
  - xAxis
  - yAxis
  - Polar
  - RadiusAxis
  - AngleAxis
  - Radar
  - DataZoom
  - VisualMap
  - Tooltip
  - AxisPointer
  - Toolbox
  - Brush
  - Geo
  - Parallel
  - ParallelAxis
  - SingleAxis
  - Timeline
  - Graphic
  - Calendar

### 3. General Configuration Tab
- Chart Title input field
- Background Color picker with hex input
- Chart Type selector (bar, line, pie, etc.)
- Animation toggle and duration setting
- Zoom functionality toggle

### 4. Grid Configuration
- Visual grid configuration interface
- Spacing and positioning controls
- Formatting options

### 5. Axis Configuration
- Separate configuration panels for X and Y axes
- Axis title, labels, and tick configuration
- Scale and range settings
- Grid line customization

### 6. Export Functionality
- Export finished chart configuration as JSON
- Generate React/Next.js component code
- Download chart as image (PNG/SVG)
- Copy configuration to clipboard

### 7. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Collapsible panels for smaller screens

## Technical Requirements

### Front-end
- Next.js 14+ application
- TypeScript for type safety
- Apache ECharts integration
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS or other CSS framework
- Theme support (light/dark mode)

### State Management
- React Context API or Redux for state management
- Local storage for saving draft configurations
- Form validation for configuration inputs

### Performance
- Optimized rendering for real-time preview updates
- Lazy loading for complex configuration panels
- Efficient state updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders

## User Interface

### Layout
- Left sidebar: Chart components panel
- Center: Chart preview area
- Right sidebar: Configuration panel with tabs
- Top: Navigation and export options

### Configuration Panel Tabs
1. General
   - Chart type, title, background color, animation settings
2. Layout
   - Spacing, margins, size, positioning
3. Text Style
   - Font family, size, weight, color for various text elements
4. Advanced
   - Event handling, tooltips, interactivity options

### Workflow
1. User selects chart type from General tab
2. User adds required components from left sidebar
3. User configures each component using right sidebar
4. Chart preview updates in real-time
5. User exports final configuration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- Implement basic layout with sidebars and preview area
- Create component architecture for configuration panels
- Establish state management system
- Build basic chart preview functionality

### Phase 2: Basic Chart Types
- Implement configuration UI for bar charts
- Add line chart support
- Add pie chart support
- Create general configuration panel
- Implement real-time preview updates

### Phase 3: Advanced Components
- Add support for all axis types
- Implement grid configuration
- Add data zoom functionality
- Implement visual mapping components
- Add tooltip and toolbox configuration

### Phase 4: Export and Polish
- Implement JSON export functionality
- Add code generation feature
- Create image export capability
- Polish UI and improve responsive design
- Add theme support

### Phase 5: Additional Features
- Implement data import from CSV/JSON
- Add template gallery with pre-configured charts
- Create shareable configurations
- Add collaborative editing features

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time to create charts compared to direct ECharts API usage
- Number of users adopting the tool for chart creation
- Variety of chart types created with the tool
- User satisfaction based on feedback and surveys
- Reduced support requests for chart configuration

## Constraints and Limitations
- Must support all major ECharts features
- Compatibility with Next.js 14+ and React 18+
- Performance considerations for complex chart configurations
- Browser compatibility requirements (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Future Considerations
- Integration with data sources (databases, APIs)
- AI-assisted chart configuration
- Custom chart component creation
- Advanced animation and interaction features
- Collaborative real-time editing
