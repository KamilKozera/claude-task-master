# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build General Configuration Tab
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the general configuration tab with basic chart settings
# Details:
Create the general configuration tab containing chart title input field, background color picker with hex input, chart type selector (bar, line, pie, etc.), animation toggle and duration settings, and zoom functionality toggle. Implement real-time updating of preview as settings change. Add validation for input fields. Use appropriate UI controls for each setting type (color pickers, dropdowns, toggles, etc.).

# Test Strategy:
Test each individual control to verify it updates the chart correctly. Check input validation for fields like color hex values. Verify that chart type changes update the preview accurately. Test animation settings to ensure they apply correctly. Validate zoom functionality with different chart types.
