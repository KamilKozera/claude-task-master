# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core layout structure with sidebars and chart preview area
# Details:
Implement the three-panel layout: left sidebar for chart components panel, center area for chart preview, and right sidebar for configuration panels with tabs. Create responsive layout that works across different screen sizes. Implement collapsible panels for mobile views. Set up navigation bar at the top for export options and other actions. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout structuring with appropriate breakpoints for responsive design.

# Test Strategy:
Test layout on different screen sizes to verify responsiveness. Check that panels collapse and expand correctly on mobile views. Verify that the layout maintains proper proportions across different viewport sizes. Test navigation elements for proper positioning and visibility.
