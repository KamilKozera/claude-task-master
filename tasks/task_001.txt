# Title: Setup Next.js Project with TypeScript
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript support and install necessary dependencies
# Details:
Create a new Next.js project using the create-next-app CLI tool with TypeScript template. Configure the project structure following Next.js best practices. Install required dependencies including Apache ECharts, React 18+, and Tailwind CSS or another CSS framework for styling. Set up basic configuration files including tsconfig.json with appropriate settings for the project.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds without errors using 'npm run build'. Ensure proper TypeScript configuration by checking type-checking with 'npm run type-check'. Confirm all dependencies are correctly installed and can be imported in test files.
