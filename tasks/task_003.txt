# Title: Integrate Apache ECharts with Next.js
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Apache ECharts integration with Next.js and create base chart component
# Details:
Create a base chart component that integrates Apache ECharts with React/Next.js. Implement proper lifecycle management for the ECharts instance, including initialization, resize handling, and cleanup. Set up the chart rendering logic with option passing. Handle chart initialization and updates efficiently. Implement a mechanism to pass configuration options to the chart. Set up chart instance cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that a simple chart renders correctly. Test chart resize handling by changing viewport size. Check that chart updates when configuration changes without full re-renders. Validate proper cleanup by monitoring memory usage during component mount/unmount cycles.
