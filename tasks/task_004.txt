# Description: Create a state management system for chart configuration using React Context API or Redux
# Details:
Implement a state management system using React Context API or Redux to manage chart configuration state. Create necessary reducers, actions, and selectors for manipulating chart options. Set up proper state structure to match ECharts configuration schema. Implement local storage integration to save draft configurations. Ensure efficient updates by minimizing unnecessary re-renders. Create a system for tracking configuration history/undo capability.

# Test Strategy:
Test state updates with various configuration changes. Verify that state is correctly persisted in local storage. Check that state changes reflect in the chart preview. Validate that the state structure properly maps to ECharts options. Test undo/redo functionality if implemented.
