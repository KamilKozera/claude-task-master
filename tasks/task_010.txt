# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement theme support (light/dark mode) and polish the UI
# Details:
Add theme support with light and dark mode options that affect both the UI and generated charts. Implement theme switching functionality. Polish UI elements for a professional look and feel. Optimize performance for complex configurations. Add final touches like loading states, error boundaries, and helpful empty states. Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation for accessibility. Add final responsive design adjustments for edge cases.

# Test Strategy:
Test theme switching to verify both UI and charts update correctly. Validate performance with complex chart configurations. Check accessibility using screen readers and keyboard navigation. Test error boundaries by forcing component errors. Verify responsive design on unusual screen sizes and orientations.
