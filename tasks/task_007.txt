# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Axis and Grid Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build configuration panels for axes and grid settings
# Details:
Create configuration panels for X and Y axes with settings for axis title, labels, tick configuration, scale, range, and grid lines. Implement grid configuration with spacing, positioning, and formatting controls. Add visual controls where possible (sliders, visual grid editor). Include responsive settings that adapt to chart size changes. Implement proper validation for numeric input fields.

# Test Strategy:
Test all axis settings to verify they reflect correctly in the chart. Validate grid configurations with different spacing and positioning options. Check interaction between grid and axis settings to ensure they work together properly. Test edge cases like very large or small values for scales and ranges.
