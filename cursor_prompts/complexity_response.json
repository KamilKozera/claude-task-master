    "taskTitle": "Implement State Management System",
    "complexityScore": 8,
    "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
    "expansionPrompt": "Break down the state management implementation into: 1) Designing the state structure to match ECharts configuration schema, 2) Creating reducers and actions for state manipulation, 3) Implementing selectors and state access patterns, 4) Adding local storage persistence, 5) Implementing undo/redo functionality",
    "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive state management system for complex chart configurations is highly complex. The state structure must precisely match ECharts' schema, handle deep nested updates efficiently, support local storage persistence, and potentially implement history tracking. This requires advanced React patterns and careful performance optimization."

    "reasoning": "Axis and grid configuration is complex because it requires specialized controls for many parameters, understanding the mathematical aspects of scales and ranges, and potentially implementing visual editors for grid positioning. This requires deep knowledge of ECharts' axis and grid configuration options."
